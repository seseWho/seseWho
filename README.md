# 👋 Hi, I’m Sese

**Software Architect · AI Expert · Generative AI · Systems Design**

I work on **architecture-heavy systems** where clarity, responsibility and long-term
maintainability matter more than trends or hype.

Most of my work lives in **private or organizational repositories**.
This profile documents **what I’m currently building and refining**.

## 🧭 Current focus

### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (Expert Role)
- Acting as **technical AI reference**, defining:
  - when AI adds real value
  - when deterministic systems are the right choice
  - how AI is safely integrated into production architectures
- Defining a **strategy for AI integration within a Software Engineering department**,
  covering:
  - development workflows
  - internal tooling and automation
  - decision-support systems
  - governance, traceability and responsibility
- Designing a **local LLM evaluation framework** to compare models by real use cases  
  (coding, reasoning, structured output, latency).

---

### 🧠 AI-driven research & intelligence systems
- Working on **EU Fund Radar**, an AI-assisted system for:
  - identifying relevant European funding opportunities
  - analyzing calls, topics and constraints
  - supporting strategic and research decision-making
- Focused on combining structured data pipelines with LLM-based analysis,
  producing **explainable and auditable outputs**.

---

### 📈 Algorithmic Trading Systems
- Architecting **Herni**, a **broker-agnostic trading core** (currently running on MetaTrader 5).
- Designing multi-strategy systems with:
  - explicit and auditable risk models
  - deterministic execution paths
  - backtesting and validation pipelines
- Using AI strictly as **support and analysis tooling**, never as a black box.

---

### 🧱 Software Architecture
- Strong focus on **Clean Architecture** and explicit composition.
- Clear separation between:
  - domain
  - application
  - infrastructure
- Preference for:
  - typed errors and explicit contracts
  - testability by layer
  - observability as a first-class concern

---

## ⛓️ Blockchain experience
- Worked on **Solana-based systems** within organizational projects.
- Experience centered on:
  - performance-oriented architectures
  - real-world use cases
  - pragmatic design decisions

---

## 🧠 Engineering principles
- Architecture is about **constraints and trade-offs**, not frameworks.
- AI should **augment understanding**, not hide responsibility.
- Prefer **boring, explicit designs** over clever abstractions.
- Systems must be auditable, explainable and evolvable.
